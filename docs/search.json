    "text": "🎥 My Story\nMy favorite part of my academic and professional journey has been combining my business knowledge with data analytics to solve real-world problems. During my undergraduate studies in economics, I developed a strong foundation in data analysis techniques, learning key skills in SQL, business statistics and econometrics. However, I realized that hands-on experience was essential to applying these skills effectively, so I tried opportunities to intern with top organizations.\nIn my recent internship at Hellobike, one of China’s largest mobility platforms, I utilized SQL and Tableau to create dashboards that made complex data accessible and actionable for stakeholders. By conducting A/B testing and statistical analysis, I optimized user interface design, resulting in an 8.68% increase in click-through rates.\nThis experience underscored the importance of understanding user needs and translating data insights into clear, data-driven recommendations. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I honed my ability to communicate complex data insights in an easily understandable way, further aligning our strategies with business goals.\nNow, as a Master’s student in Business Analytics, I am deepening my technical expertise and learning to leverage big data tools like Python, SQL, and cloud-hosted databases. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills in data analytics and my experience in client-focused solutions to industries and empower consumers and businesses to make informed decisions and thrive."
