    "text": "🎥 My Story\nMy favorite part of my academic and professional journey has been combining my business knowledge with data analytics to solve real-world problems. During my undergraduate studies in economics, I developed a strong foundation in data analysis techniques, learning key skills in SQL, business statistics and econometrics. However, I realized that hands-on experience was essential to applying these skills effectively, so I tried opportunities to intern with top organizations.\nIn my recent internship at Hellobike, one of China’s largest mobility platforms, I utilized SQL and Tableau to create dashboards that made complex data accessible and actionable for stakeholders. By conducting A/B testing and statistical analysis, I optimized user interface design, resulting in an 8.68% increase in click-through rates.\nThis experience underscored the importance of understanding user needs and translating data insights into clear, data-driven recommendations. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I honed my ability to communicate complex data insights in an easily understandable way, further aligning our strategies with business goals.\nNow, as a Master’s student in Business Analytics, I am deepening my technical expertise and learning to leverage big data tools like Python, SQL, and cloud-hosted databases. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills in data analytics and my experience in client-focused solutions to industries and empower consumers and businesses to make informed decisions and thrive."

These include donation history (mrm2, freq, years), demographics (female, couple), and income indicators (ltmedmra, median_hhincome).\nFor each variable, I compared:\n\nthe mean in the treatment vs control group,\na t-test of the difference in means,\nand a regression coefficient from variable ~ treatment.\n\nThe table below summarizes these tests:\n\n\nBalance Test Summaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nTreatment Mean\nControl Mean\nT-Statistic\nP-Value\nOLS Coefficient\nOLS P-Value\n\n\n\n\nmrm2\n13.01\n12.998\n0.119\n0.905\n0.014\n0.905\n\n\nfreq\n8.04\n8.05\n-0.111\n0.912\n-0.012\n0.912\n\n\nyears\n6.08\n6.14\n-1.103\n0.270\n-0.058\n0.270\n\n\nfemale\n27.5%\n28.3%\n-1.758\n0.079\n-0.008\n0.079\n\n\nltmedmra\n49.7%\n48.8%\n1.910\n0.056\n0.009\n0.056\n\n\nmedian_hhincome\n$54,763\n$54,921\n-0.742\n0.458\n-157.93\n0.458\n\n\ncouple\n9.14%\n9.30%\n-0.584\n0.559\n-0.002\n0.559\n\n\n\nNone of the above variables show statistically significant differences (all p-values &gt; 0.05).

These findings mirror Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007)."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\nI begin by analyzing whether receiving a matching donation offer increases the likelihood of giving. As shown in the bar chart below, the response rate for the treatment group was 2.20%, while the control group had a response rate of only 1.79%.\n\n\n\n\nProportion of People Who Donated\n\n\n\nI conduct a two-sample t-test to compare the mean donation rate (gave) between the treatment and control groups:\n\nControl mean: ~1.79%\n\nTreatment mean: ~2.20%\n\nT-statistic: 3.10\n\np-value: 0.0019\n\nThis result indicates that the difference is statistically significant at the 1% level. In other words, people who received a matching donation offer were significantly more likely to donate.\n\nBivariate Linear Regression\nI also ran a linear regression model: gave ~ treatment:\n\nCoefficient on treatment: 0.00418\n\np-value: 0.0019\n\nThis suggests that assignment to treatment increases the donation probability by about 0.4 percentage points, which is a small but statistically meaningful effect, especially given the scale of the fundraising campaign. Together, the t-test and the regression confirm the same conclusion: the treatment group donated at a significantly higher rate than the control group.\n\n\n\nProbit Regression\nTo confirm the finding using a nonlinear model (as in the original paper), I also estimate a probit regression with the same dependent variable:\n\nProbit coefficient on treatment: 0.087\np-value: 0.0019\n\nThis replicates the finding in Table 3, Column 1 of Karlan & List (2007), where the authors also find that the presence of a match significantly increases the probability of donation.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\nt test\nI conduct pairwise t-tests comparing donation rates across different match ratio groups within the treatment group:\n\n$1:$1 vs $2:$1: t = -0.97, p = 0.335\n\n$2:$1 vs $3:$1: t = -0.05, p = 0.960\n\n$1:$1 vs $3:$1: t = -1.02, p = 0.310\n\nNone of these comparisons are statistically significant at the 5% level, which suggests that increasing the match ratio does not significantly increase the likelihood of giving—consistent with the authors’ conclusion on page 8 of the paper.\n\n\nRegression Analysis\nI also fit a linear regression model where the dependent variable is gave and the independent variables are ratio2 and ratio3, using $1:$1 match as the baseline:\ngave = β₀ + β₁ * ratio2 + β₂ * ratio3 + ε\nRegression output summary:\n\nCoefficient on ratio2: 0.0019, p = 0.338\nCoefficient on ratio3: 0.0020, p = 0.313\n\nThe coefficients are small and statistically insignificant, confirming the same conclusion as the t-tests.\nDifference in Donation Rates\nWe also directly compute the difference in response rates:\n\nFrom $1:$1 to $2:$1: +0.00188 (≈ 0.19 percentage points)\nFrom $2:$1 to $3:$1: +0.0001 (≈ 0.01 percentage points)\n\nFrom the regression coefficients:\n\nratio3 - ratio2 = +0.0001\n\nThese small and statistically insignificant changes indicate that donors do not respond more strongly to larger match ratios. Simply offering a match matters, but increasing the match ratio offers no additional benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\nFull Sample Analysis (Including Non-Donors)\nFirst, I compare average donation amounts across all individuals, including those who gave $0. Using both a t-test and a linear regression:\n\nMean amount (control) = $0.813\n\nMean amount (treatment) = $0.967\n\nOLS coefficient on treatment = 0.1536\n\nt-statistic = 1.861\n\np-value = 0.063\n\nThe positive coefficient indicates that the treatment group gave slightly more on average. However, the p-value is just above the common 0.05 threshold, suggesting marginal significance. Most of the observed difference appears to be driven by the fact that more people gave in the treatment group, rather than those who gave giving significantly more.\n\n\nConditional on Donation\nI then limit the analysis to individuals who actually made a donation (gave == 1). I repeat the same steps:\n\nMean amount (control) = $45.54\n\nMean amount (treatment) = $43.87\n\nOLS coefficient on treatment = -1.668\n\nt-statistic = -0.581\n\np-value = 0.561\n\nThese results suggest that conditional on donating, people in the treatment group did not give more, and actually gave slightly less on average (though not statistically significantly). The p-value of 0.561 indicates no meaningful difference.\nThis implies that the treatment’s impact was primarily at the extensive margin (increasing the number of people who gave), and not at the intensive margin (increasing donation amount conditional on giving). This result supports the original conclusion from Karlan & List (2007).\n\n\nHistograms of Donation Amounts\nBelow are two histograms showing the distribution of donation amounts among donors, separated by treatment group. The red dashed line represents the group mean."

For each sample size, I repeat the experiment 1000 times, and in each trial I compute the average difference in donation rate:\n\nAt n = 50, the distribution is wide and irregular. The mean is slightly right of zero, but there’s a lot of noise. Zero is near the center.\nAt n = 200, the distribution starts to resemble a bell shape, but still has considerable spread.\nAt n = 500, the distribution becomes noticeably more symmetric, and the mean difference starts to stand out from zero.\nAt n = 1000, the distribution is tightly centered around 0.004, and zero is clearly in the left tail, indicating a consistent positive treatment effect.\n\n\n\n\nCLT Simulation\n\n\nI conclude that as sample size increases, the distribution of the average difference between treatment and control becomes more normal and more centered around the true mean—exactly as predicted by the Central Limit Theorem."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project gave me a chance to explore how matching donations affect charitable giving by replicating the results from Karlan & List (2007). After digging into the data, I found that people who received a matching offer were definitely more likely to donate—just like the original paper said. Even though the increase was small in percentage terms, it’s meaningful when you’re dealing with tens of thousands of people.\nOne thing that stood out to me was that higher match ratios (like 2:1 or 3:1) didn’t really help any more than the basic 1:1 offer. So the key seems to be just having a match at all—not how big the match is.\nWhen I looked at how much people gave, it turned out that the treatment group gave slightly more overall, but not because they gave more money individually. Instead, the bump came from more people deciding to give, not from people giving larger amounts.\nOverall, this was a great example of how subtle changes in message framing (like offering a match) can change real-world behavior. And it showed me how field experiments and behavioral economics can go hand-in-hand."
